# Big Blue's Parking Genie

## The Djinns - Group 10

A Djinn in Arabic lore is a shapeshifting spirit that possesses supernatural powers that can be conjured to perform various tasks and services. Djinns that have the ability to grant wishes are more colloquially known as genies. Big Blue's Parking Genie takes the unique form of a website that serves all your parking management needs. We aim to make finding parking as easy as making a wish. 

## Version-control procedures 

We will be using git and GitHub as verson control for this project. Group members will be assigned diffrent sections as of the project as marked in TODO.md. Group members will fork the main branch and work on their section on their own. Once they are done they will mark their section as done in the TODO and merge their branch abck to main. There is also a column in the TODO that indicates that that portion should not be worked on by anyone else if that mark is checked in order to minimise merge problems.

Project milestones will be tagged with the "Milestone_$n" tag where $n is the milestone number.
