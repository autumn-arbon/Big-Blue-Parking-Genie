Project Plan

# Big Blue's Parking Genie

## Project Overview
This project’s objective is to provide a system for selling and buying parking spots at Utah State University.

The system will be designed for large events on the campus such as sporting events, musical productions, graduation, etc. Owners of large parking lots as well as single parking spaces will be able to list various types of parking spots available through the system. Customers looking for a parking spot on or near USU’s campus will be able to purchase one or more spots and receive their confirmation ticket through the system. Other users will be able to use the system as well, such as parking lot supervisors and attendants. The system will be capable of running through the web on a PC, Android, and iOS mobile device.

## Team Organization
*(The team description should be complete and accurate, yet concise. You may refer to the text book or other authors for standard team organizations. Be sure to describe any team philosophies that you intend to adapt (e.g. egoless programming). You may use a figure to describe your team organization.  Also, you may anticipate shifts in responsibilities as the project progresses)*

For each milestone in the project, there will be a different project leader.

## Software Development Process

The development will be broken up into five phases.  Each phase will be a little like a Sprint in an Agile method and a little like an iteration in a Spiral process.  Specifically, each phase will be like a Sprint, in that work to be done will be organized into small tasks, placed into a “backlog”, and prioritized.   Then, using on time-box scheduling, the team will decide which tasks the phase (Sprint) will address.  The team will use a Scrum Board to keep track of tasks in the backlog, those that will be part of the current Sprint, those in progress, and those that are done.

Each phase will also be a little like an iteration in a Spiral process, in that each phase will include some risk analysis and that any development activity (requirements capture, analysis, design, implementation, etc.) can be done during any phase.  Early phases will focus on understanding (requirements capture and analysis) and subsequent phases will focus on design and implementation.  Each phase will include a retrospective.

| **Phase** | **Iteration** |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1. | Phase 1 - Requirements Capture |
| 2. | Phase 2 - Analysis, Architectural, UI, and DB Design |
| 3. | Phase 3 - Implementation, and Unit Testing |
| 4. | Phase 4 - More Implementation and Testing  |

We will use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to document user goals, structural concepts, component interactions, and behaviors.

## Communication Policies, Procedures, and Tools
*(Describe your communication policies and procedures.)*

Our team will mainly use text messaging and Zoom to communicate about the project. Outside of regular class time, we will meet at least once a week for updates on the project and plans moving forward. We will all be working on the same Git repository, so we will communicate about details there as well. We have sections of the repo that contain our brainstorming/idea documents and other collaborations.

## Risk Analysis
*Potential risks we see coming up in the future*

## Configuration Management
