Sprint 2 Retrospective:

- 1 html page left
- all but 1 html page connected to Django
- Map API is mostly functional - can show an event and lot locations on map

Functionality working so far:
- reserve spot, still needs to render lots and spots according to previous selections
- login/create account
- main page showing upcoming events and conditional rendering
